This is our website for our Intergrated Studio Project. This is an eCommerce Fashion/Clothing website called Waire Clothes. 

**Design Process**

The theme of this website is purple, 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

**Existing Features**

Log In and Sign Up Feature - allows users to create an account by entering their username and password, and log into their account by entering their exisiting username and pasword.
Nav Bar - allows users to interchange between pages easier by clicking the pages they want to go to at the top of the page.
Daily Log In Feature - allows users to view their streak and earn points by claiming and logging in daily.
Announcement - allows users to be updated and alerted of any announcements at the annoucments section in the homepage.

**Features Left to Implement**

Most of the features on the mobile app can be found on the website aswell. However, some features did not make the cut due to time constraint. One feature we would wish to implement is the game 'Fashion Frenzy' that is playable on the mobile app. It is a competition game that allows users to create outfits and submit them in order to win prizes and be top of the leaderboard.
Another feature we wanted to add was

**Technologies Used**

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

**JQuery**
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

**Contact form:**

Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

So far, the first few main pages and the nav bars have been made to be responsive on different browsers and devices. However, due to time constraint not the whole website is responsive.  

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
