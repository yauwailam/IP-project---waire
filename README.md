Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

So far, the first few main pages and the nav bars have been made to be responsive on different browsers and devices. However, due to time constraint not the whole website is responsive.  

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
