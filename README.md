Features Left to Implement

Most of the features on the mobile app can be found on the website aswell. However, some features did not make the cut due to time constraint. One feature we would wish to implement is the game 'Fashion Frenzy' that is playable on the mobile app. It is a competition game that allows users to create outfits and submit them in order to win prizes and be top of the leaderboard.

Contact form:

Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

So far, the first few main pages and the nav bars have been made to be responsive on different browsers and devices. However, due to time constraint not the whole website is responsive.  

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
